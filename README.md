# budget-planning-app
Written in react and redux on the frontend, and ruby on rails on the backend, 'budget-planning-app' is a tool to make personal budgeting simple.  Efficient, and easy to use, everyone can use this app to create financial plans and refer to them.

Clone down this repository to your local environment.
Cd into the backend, and run 'rails s -p 3001'.
Cd into the frontend, in a seperate terminal window, and run 'npm start'.

Create your budget/s!
Sign up with your username and password.  You will be able to sign in later with these credentials.
Click on 'new template' in the navigation bar to begin budgeting.
You now have the ability to create one transferable template.  If you do not know what kind of template to create, try to make a monthly budget.
Give your template a title that will be easily distinguishable to you.  Perhaps 'monthly'.
What are your sources of income in a month?  Write the descriptions and amounts in the income fields.  Try to be as accurate as possible.
Your total income will automatically be displayed below the income fields.
Write your expenses in the expenses fields.
The total expenditure and the difference between your income and expenses will be displayed below.
If the total difference is a positive number, you know that you have surplus income.
Consider putting that money in an emergency fund or another savings account.
If the total difference is a negative number, you are going to be short!
Suggestions if you are short:  
Review all the incomes and expenses to make sure they are correct.
Look at how you can reduce costs.  ex.  Can you buy second hand instead of new?  Can you stop eating/drinking coffee out?  
Can you create additional income?  Do you own anything that you no longer love, and can sell?  (This can also help reduce clutter).
Remember, look at what is most important to you on your expenses, and pay for those.
The above are really short time solutions for people that are in potential financial jeopardy.  If this is a monthly budget template that you expect to be about the same every month, and your total difference is 0 or in the negative,  then you have more changes to make in order to be sustainable! Possible reductions of expenditure include: move dwellings to somewhere more affordable, grow vegetables, switch to a more affordable method of transportation.. or look at the possible increases of income. Ex. Change careers/jobs or find additional work.  If you have members of your family not working but able, they should find employment.  (Consider buisnessess that you can operate from home with minimal/zero physical contact with others).
Save your template, and refer to it later!
